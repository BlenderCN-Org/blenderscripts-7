# BlenderScripts

My Collection of Blender 3D python scripts

Got any questions? Contact me.. glad to help

Please be aware that Clone/Download won't give you a Blender installation file.
Just copy the files you want to your scripts folder.

Remarks/Functionality:
## KTX_Tools.py is the only file needed when you want the Bottle/Cap script
- KTX_MeshVersions.py is an Addon to save/restore versions of meshes during editing.
- KTX_Selectbuffer.py is an Addon to enable a select buffer.. Select something.. add it to a buffer, select others and do a boolean selection on the previous selection
- KTX_Library_* will add themselves to your ADD MESH menu
- KTX_Library_Materials.py needs KTX_Objects.blend (put your own materials in that blend file)
- KTX_Library_NodeGroups.py needs KTX_Objects.blend (put your own nodegroups in that blend file)
- KTX_Library_Objects.py needs KTX_Objects.blend (put your own objects in that blend file)

- KTX_Library_Import_OBJ holds a script to import OBJ files.. but you have to edit the script and change line 22 to point to your OBJ folder

- KTX_Tools.py is a collection of unrelated tools I've created through the years.. mostly for testing/training purposes
- KTX_Tools.py only needs KTX_Objects.blend if you want to use the simple version of KTX Object Library inside it.
